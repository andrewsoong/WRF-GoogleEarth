This repository contains scripts for creating KMZ files from WRF output files
as well as classes that can be extended for customizing the output.  A description
of the code can be found at http://www.openwfm.org/wiki/Visualization_in_Google_Earth.
The main script, nc2kmz.py, generates a file called fire.kmz, which when opened
in Google Earth shows the heat flux coming from the fire as a ground overlay.  This
script will not work on idealized simulations because they cannot be geolocated.
The script take one argument, the output NetCDF file,

python nc2kmz.py <wrfout>

Python modules required:
  matplotlib
  netCDF4  or  Scientific
